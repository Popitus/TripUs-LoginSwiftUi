# TripUs-LoginSwiftUi

A simple demo of LoginView with video background in SwiftUI. Each component is separated and designed to be easily reusable in future projects.

With this view, you can easily implement a login process that reads user data from an API, complete with smooth animations and a seamless user experience.

To promote maintainability and scalability, this project adheres to a layered architecture pattern. The presentation layer is responsible for rendering the UI, while the data layer handles data storage and networking tasks. The domain layer encapsulates the core business logic of the application.

By separating these concerns into distinct layers, the project is more modular and easier to maintain over time. Changes to one layer can be made without affecting other layers, minimizing the risk of introducing unexpected behavior. Additionally, this architecture supports the reuse of components across the application and facilitates the testing of individual layers in isolation.

Feel free to download and explore the project code, and let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
